For this article and my other CTA-related GA nom (Pulaski (CTA Orange Line), I tried to put that info where it seemed to be in the other train station GAs, which are remarkably inconsistent as to this (and as to formatting in general, for that matter). I initially used the format in Storo (station), which lists location info under facilities. Other formats I've seen make location info its own paragraph (Jordanhill railway station), combine all service, facilities, and location info (Sturtevant (Amtrak station), or don't even include location info (Embankment tube station).

            "\"lol. Regardless of intent or accident - I actually wish that GoingBatty would listen to my request and avoid pages that I'm working on. GoingBatty was (and still is) not interested in  Brazilian Hip Hop unless he's a secret gangster rapper. Maybe after a hard day in the hood with his scout charges this scoutmaster relaxes by expressing himself through rap. Anyway I'm bored by him and a whole bunch of other editors - all of whom seem to be here either as incognito moralists, conservatives, protectors of childhood, nationalists, etc. I imagine that many of the neo-nazi groups are here also. Its my experience of right-wingers that on the whole they don't want you to know what they are up too. I remember an arts center open mic night which I was attending being infiltrated by five or six or them. It was a surreal situation because none of them were actually musicians - they pretended to be comedians which allowed them the right to attend and perform. The woman who ran the night and who had no idea of how the BNP (British National Party) worked had put one of them in charge. I emailed the arts center due to the fact that I knew some of the people who ran the open mic nights (including the woman who had been put in overall charge and had made the decision to put him in charge) and got an email back saying the open mic nights were for everyone regardless of their political views. A week or two later I received another email saying that the arts center had decided to separate the comedy from the music by having separate nights for both. I'm  not too sure why but I do know that at one of the open mic nights the leader of this small BNP cell had been put in charge and after one of the singers had finished (she was colored) he said something that was really strange. I can't say what because people who were there may be reading this but it was racist. About a hundred people witnessed and heard what he said and everyone just sat silently in shock not knowing how to react - after all he was in charge. Now that is power. When you can persuade others that your intent is one thing and then position yourself to impose your will or views upon those who believe your original lie - well that is political power. Its not even a right wing thing since many left wing leaders have used to same ploy. It is the nature of a dogmatic personality who is seeking power to follow such a course when faced with opposition to their dogma. Here's what happened after the torrent scene released the membership list of the BNP and I spotted that one of them was a town planning consultant employed by my local council. I sent an email to my council of course. Evidently my council believe that hiring a BNP member as a town planning consultant for one of the most highly diverse ethnic towns in England was fine because his racist views shouldn't affect his ability to provide good advice. lol \n",

In Vukovar I do not see that you are striving so to put Serbian-Cyrillic version in the infobox, and there ar Serbians over 25%. In Croatia, there are also other locations where Serbs and other minorities live, but their share of the total population is not so much, so I added not there the Serbian name. So it should be also in Serbia. In Novi Sad are not even 4% of Hungary, and for the city names in other languages where are the minorities of a city are not significante, we have the section name, so what ist the problem?. If the Hungarians in Novi Sad 25%, I will add the Hungarian citiy name, but they arent. In other locations thats totaly OK, becaus they are the Hungarians the majority, but in Novi Sad no. After your version every location must have 5-6 name in the infobox and the road sig ns, but forget it, I and you not thats not true, so dont tell me this, i visited the whole Balkan 100 times. In the whole World, Novi Sad is official, or do you see for Wien the Serbian city name Bec? So, accept the piecfull situation and consensus like before, wher we was agreed to put the city name of a minority language, if they have 25 % share of the total population.

Instead of editing out the paragraph that was removed today, which contained a link to a map, as well as an internal link to the ongoing Caledonia land dispute, a subject quite relevant in the Grand Valley these days, I'd like to see the entire history section itself brought up to a higher standard. In my opinion, from a historical perspective, the article itself would benefit more if some of the earlier comments in it regarding the acquisition of the land by the Six Nations were edited out and replaced by the material that was removed today. As I said back in August, I'm willing to work on this article myself as time allows, but in my opinion it doesn't make sense removing content that's not only relevant and contains references, it's actually of a higher quality than what remains.\n",

To act in a manner that is criminal is effectively a declaration that the faith into which you were born, or claim by conversion, is effectively a sham.

Some supporters of Dom -> Rom reorganized later their theory, by including the points raised against its likeliness, by presenting the Ḍom as a cover-term for itinerant service-providing castes and the three group as originating in different areas within India, speaking different (albeit related) Indian languages, and probably leaving the Subcontinent at different times, taking different routes.

            "The subject homophobia and the definition of the term homophobia are not the same thing. The subject of homophobia is (in short) the fear or hatred of gays, or discrimination or prejudice against them. The AFA is a recognized part of a body of groups, people, and ideas that define modern-day homophobia. There's no way you can deny that, even if you believe that the label is undeserved, that the label could be pejorative in a non-encyclopedic context, or that somehow being categorized under \"\"homophobia\"\" and being an organization somehow equates to being categorized as \"\"homophobic organization.\"\" The categories \"\"homophobic organization\"\" and \"\"homophobe\"\" were deleted because they are, grammatically, constructed to specifically modify or describe the subject in question. \"\"Homophobia\"\" is not, and these false analogies may make it seem like we're out go get the AFA, but we aren't. Although Sam seems to think it's an irrelevant personal comment, it is the case, Hal, that since you got here, you've been arguing that the AFA's opinion of itself should more of a part of the article, and that criticism should not be. Miles have been spun about how much of a big deal this is, that we're gay activists, that we're creating attack articles, that the category homophobia is a pejorative attack on whatever it labels. Now, Sam, I know you'll insist on removing this part of my comment (editing/censoring others' comments is a practice that is, by the way, fairly dubious). But remember that we are supposed to discuss the issue at hand, not the character of others - I'm not attacking Hal's character. But his history of editing for the sake of the AFA is completely relevant to this discussion and a part of the issue at hand - it explains why he believes we've constructed an attack article (hardly), why the category is a pejorative attack or accusation (clearly not), and why it must be eventually removed. I agree with Hal: it could be taken as a pejorative, and what concerns me is that it is, but only (as far as I can tell) by someone who's made it clear that portraying the AFA in a positive light is very important (no matter [[WP:UNDUE|what that entails).  \"\n",

Reference 2 (NME) is a questionable source because it is full of personal opinions and bias. And reference 3 (New York Times) states that \"\"Paramore is loosely affiliated with the world of emo\"\". Is loose affiliation enough to place Paramore in the Emo genre? I'm going to be bold, and say no; this is probably going to start some edit war, but I'm removing the Emo genre from the page as per WP:QS. Without credible sources, I will hunt down sources which prove they are not of the Emo genre and place them on this talk page. And before anyone points at the Joshua Martin quote saying that it proves they're emo, that is a writer's personal opinion of what they think Paramore's music sounds like. It would be like saying... French toast is bread, but with icing sugar, and its less healthy; yet French toast and bread aren't the same thing. They may seem similar, and may have qualities of each other, but they don't taste, look, smell, or feel like each other... and in before \"\"French toast isn't Paramore\"\", it's an analogy...

As for proof that people have been defining 'vestigial' with still being able to have some functions (that could have been worded better) since the theory  began, take a look at the sources I added to the Vestigial structures article. Darwin, Weismann and Wiedersheim (who is credited with coining the term 'vestigial' to refer to them) all used it in this way right from the beginning, in the 19th century.

            "There are three things to point out about this discussion:\n",
            "1. The \"\"material\"\" concept of time. Time here is not intended as an abstract entity, a chronological coordinate, as we are used to.  A \"\"time\"\" is the complex of all existing beings, things, circumstances and processes occurring in a particular historical instant. So it 's like an enormous set including everything existing or going on at that moment. If you consider the next instant, another enormous set is determined and that 's different form the previous one, as many things or situations have been changed. So we are included in the times because we are among the countless things and beings \"\"contained\"\" in the flowing times.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Sorry Memoro, but I must notice that your feeling of a possible deponent behaviour of the verb \"\"muto\"\" is baseless and factually incorrect.\n",
            "Indeed, consulting several Latin grammars and dictionaries I found no trace, no hint of a use of \"\"muto\"\" as a deponent or semi-deponent verb, at least in the classics. Simply, when a verb is provided with both forms, active and passive, it cannot be a deponent.\n",
            "It is however true that \"\"mutare\"\", as well as \"\"to change\"\" in English, may have a transitive or intransitive meaning. When it is transitive there is someone who performs changing and someone who undergoes it; so we can use the active or passive form to determine who 's the agent. We can say  \"\"I change you\"\" or \"\"I am changed by you\"\", leaving no doubt on who 's the author and who the object of changing. In the second case (the passive one) it 's wholly evident that change is not due to my will.\n",
            "With the intransitive meaning instead, the concept of voluntariness of change remains more shaded and vague. When I say: \"\"I change\"\", I make quite clear that some changing is affecting myself, but nothing is said about whether this change is due to my will or to the events, circumstances or somebody else 's will. Thus, using the active form with intransitive meaning, we can leave an open door to both possibilities:  - a. I am changing because I actually want to, or - b. I am forced to change by circumstances or others.\n",
            "Therefore, whoever was the author of this maxim, he had a simple way to let us think that we might be the artificers of our own change. He only had to write the verb in its active form: \"\"mutamus\"\". A simple \"\"s\"\" instead of an \"\"r\"\". That wouldn 't even afffect the hexameter 's rhythm. But he (purposedly in my opinion) chose the passive form; so expressly underlining our \"\"passivity to the change\"\".\n",
            "Moreover, he used a special trick to give an even stronger emphasis to the passivity. Normally speaking in Latin, one would say \"\"et nos mutamur\"\"; but here we see \"\"nos et mutamur\"\". Exchanging the pronoun with the conjunction is a rare expedient to emphasize the latter (in Latin language, everything that comes \"\"after\"\" has higher importance in a sentence 's  context). This special exchange serves to point out that this \"\"nos et\"\" is not a simple \"\"et nos\"\"; we should translate it as \"\"and we too\"\"; but other stronger translations could be: \"\"and we forcedly\"\", \"\"and we ineluctably\"\", \"\"and we a fortiori\"\". \n",
            "All this drives me to the conclusion that the sentence 's author wanted to stress as much strongly as possible that we are \"\"passive\"\" poor things in front of the general changing going on through the entire universe. So the true extensive meaning of the phrase is:\n",
            "\"\"When everything existing in the universe is subject to change by circumstances and force majeure; how could we, poor little human things, pretend not being changed as well?\"\"\n",
            "This way of reasoning comes quite natural if you \"\"think in Latin\"\".\n",
            "\n",
            "3. According to the ancient and medieval way of thinking, this sentence is nothing else than an Aristotelian categorical syllogism; i.e. the basic unit of logical reasoning.\n",
            "Here we have:\n",
            "- a major premise: \"\"Tempora mutantur\"\"\n",
            "- a minor premise: \"\"in illis\"\" saying that we humans are included in times \n",
            "- a conclusion: \"\"nos et mutamur\"\".\n",
            "That simply means we are forced to change because we are part of all things that are changed.\n",
            "In mathematical logic and set theory, these relations concern set inclusion. So here are: \n",
            "a set H containing all humans; a set T containing all times (as defined above) and an even bigger set C containg all things, beings, situations, processes, and complexes af all them, that are subject to changing.\n",
            "The minor premise states that H is included in T, the major premise says T is included in C and the conclusion is H is included in C.\n",
            "In other words this is what 's usually defined as \"\"the transitive property of inclusion\"\". Thus, a synthetic translation of our sentence in sheer mathematical terms is:   H ⊂ T, T ⊂ C   ⇒  H ⊂ C\"\n",

Ok, male expose higher mutation rate and thus expose higher variability: most of the men are defected whereas others are extremely cute. They can spread they genes as hell and best features can be conserved in women, who undergo much less mutation and exist solely to conserve best genes (best trials, aka best men). This was said in the article, albeit not pronounced clearly. Better exposition of this part would shed some light on why do we have men and women in the first place. It would be even better to say something about recombination. Recombination, aka sexual reproduction or crossover is what allows to combine best features from different individuals. It makes evolution much faster than single individual mutation. Just imagine: one guy fortunately acquires one feature, another guy acquires another feature, third guy acquires some another feature. Now, if they cannot recombine and exchange their knowledge, they have to discover everything themselves. On the other hand, “If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.” Bernard Shaw explains the recombination principle: The human culture has advanced so rapidly just because you could spread the knowledge for free (I am not talking about climate in Wikipedia). Imagine that you had to discover everything yourself. You would still live in a cave age. So, recombination, sexual reproduction, is extreemly powerful. The flirt affairs sucked around is not as closely crucial. Why cannot we have even a reference to the recombination?\n",

            "Dear Macrakis: I was the one who gave that exact solution in the first place. The golden ratio naturally appears in the 5th roots of unity; if you plot the roots in the complex plane, they form the vertices of a pentagon. This then explains why you can express a lot of trigonometric angles pi*n/5 in terms of the golden ratio. For example, cos 18 = (b/4)sqrt[2] = 5^(1/4)/2 sqrt[φ].  When you solve a quintic equation, naturally the fifth roots of unity are involved, hence why the radical solution of the quintic x^5-5x+12 = 0 can be expressed in terms of the golden ratio.  I hope it is clearer now.\n",

My grade jumped to A, not because I was any smarter, but because I knew from experience what happens when resistors are wired in series and when they are wired in parallel, and to other students such matters were totally abstract.

Vocabulary is usually also more or less identical, though some local deviations do exist.

The consensus interpretation of the Lambda/cold dark matter model must clearly be flawed if it leads to the conclusion that the scientific method must be scrapped in order to save the model (ref). Dark Matter and Dark Energy are ad hoc \"\"add-ons\"\" that are trying to find theoretical justification.

The total mass of the universe has been and still is open to question. The Matter/Energy that we can inventory accounts for only 4.5% of the total needed to \"\"flatten\"\" the anisotropy pattern that is seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation or \"\"CMB\"\" (ref). This proposed revision in the \"\"total mass\"\" and the General Relativity (GR) concept of the black hole hyperbolic field will save not only SM, but the Friedmann Equations and the FLRW metric themselves too! \n",

Space with time came into existence during this instant.

Matter/Light could keep pace with the inflation of space-time only as long as its temperature was several exponential decades of degrees Kelvin. As soon as Matter/Light began to condense and the fundamental forces began to differentiate, the inflation era ended (ref). The collapse of the infinite density hyperbolic field began. This hyperbolic field has been collapsing by means of a time-dependent process ever since. It is this ongoing transition from a hyperbolic black hole gravitational field to a parabolic Newtonian gravitational field underlying the global universe that is being mistaken for acceleration and Dark Energy (ref).\n",

The few free energy machines still having their own wikipedia page are full of rant how crackpots try to destroy the laws of thermodynamics and how nutterish they are, not your usual trolling but the work of experts. Take the introduction of the Water fuel cell. \"\"the source of this addition energy has not been scientifically identified therefore the theory is treated with skepticism.\"\" There was barely any theory, it just worked! And it has not been investigated. The way it's treated is not worthy of being in the description. An encyclopedia should not instruct it's readers behaviour? Tell me how to treat things huh? \"\"such a practice conforms to the parameters of perpetual motion, hence conclusive scientific investigation would either verify violation of thermodynamic law or identify the source of claimed additional energy.\"\" But if there isn't going to be any scientific analysis - ever! then the laws of thermodynamics are nonsense. If the best scientists can do is preach the laws then it's just not very likely they are right about the topic.

This does not mean that the overall threat has reduced but that it has diversified. The reduction in cases linked to the Tribal areas of Pakistan is partly attributable to the pressure exerted on the Al Qaida leadership there. But the reduction is also partly a result of increased activity elsewhere. In Somalia, for example, there are a significant number of UK residents training in Al Shabaab camps to fight in the insurgency there.\"\" In other words, the same multinational network of would-be Al-Qaida fighters that traveled to Pakistan were also starting to travel to other areas back in 2010, including the Al-Shabaab-controlled parts of Somalia.

It takes awhile to get into the Wiki-style. If another editor reprimands you, claiming that you are in breach of policy, it would be a good idea to presume that they are correct for the next 6 months or so. There is a lot more to policy than just avoiding content forks.

            "Hi, Benne. Thank you for unearthing this need for disambiguation. I think that Mansura is usually spelled with a ta marbuta as its final letter: منصورة (manṣūrä). This comes frot the root نصر (naṣara) meaning 'help' or 'make victorious' (interestingly, in derived form II it means 'Christianize'). Therefore, منصور (manṣūr) means 'helped', 'supported', 'victorious'. The place name is the feminine version of this, perhaps representing the old accusative (with locative meaning). In Arabic, many place names begin with the definite article. Sometimes the article is kept in trasliteration and sometimes it isn't. Sometimes it's transliterated as Al and sometimes it's El. The word itself could be transliterated as Mansura, Mansoura, Mansoora, Mansurah, Mansourah, Mansoorah, Mansureh, Mansoureh, Mansooreh. It would make sense to have all of these alternatives, with and without alternatives of definite article, linking to a disambiguation page. However, the Egyptian Mansurah is by far the most important of these, so it might take precedence over the disambig. I'll see if I can tidy it up a little. —\n",

If we must use media as the only references (at least in the short term), can we lose the meaningless journalistic terminology? \"\"14 times closer\"\" is meaningless (think \"\"twice as small\"\"). Similarly, \"\"gray line\"\", and water and carbon dioxide as \"\"elements\"\". These I have changed, but I'm sure there are others. Finally, couldn't someone modify the stock image used at the end to show where in the potentially-habitable zone this planet would lie? (i.e. add a ball 1.5 times the shown Earth size to the lower left of the zone.) That would be much more meaningful than the standard stock pic shown now. Just a couple of thoughts.   \"\n",

I repeat the text you suggested above:Ijaz has also served as a media commentator, frequently writing opinion pieces and appearing on television news programs over the past two decades. He was exclusively retained by Fox News in the period immediately following the September 11 attacks, appearing on Fox programs over 100 times. He was a popular guest on the network's Special Report broadcast.Do you have any source that states all of this, and/or a collection of sources that together state this?  In this situation, we can't simply cite your opinion pieces, because no single opinion piece is good for \"\"frequently writing\"\", and taking a bunch of opinion pieces and saying \"\"see, it's frequently\"\" is the kind of thing addressed by our no-original-synthesis standard.  \"\"Appearing on TV news...\"\" This is slightly different, since a few references to TV appearances over the years would establish that you weren't a one-time guest, but again a secondary source would help by demonstrating that TV appearances were significant.  Although I know you're not a mediæval soldier, the retainer thing is a rather specific detail that really shouldn't appear unless we have a source for it — could you find something published by Fox, or something from somewhere else, noting that they'd officially retained you?  As I noted above, I looked for sources of this sort but was unable to find them.  Finally, about a Further reading section — do you know of any books that talk about you at length in a favorable light?  I'd like to present the Al Franken book together with a similar work from the opposite perspective.    \"\n",

For most applications of tensors to engineering (e.g., rigid body dynamics and stress analysis), it is not necessary to accommodate the general coordinate systems of tensor calculus.  Usually there is some fixed background frame and at worst one needs to know how things transform when that frame is rotated.  Then raising and lowering of indices is also not required, and all of the tensoriality is essentially quite trivial (so suitable for engineers).  It seems to me that this is the intended scope of the article, but it might be helpful if it stated this plainly somewhere, although it is possible that I might have misunderstood what is meant by \"\"rectangular coordinate system\"\".\n",

I think some time should be devoted to discussing examples.

He called the support races with 1980 F1 World Champ Alan Jones. In 1997 he was hired by Ten to host the Australian Super Touring Championship for 2-litre Touring Cars - a position previously held by his close friend Leigh Diffey who had moved on to Network Ten's V8 Supercar coverage.  Rust commentated the Aust. Super Touring Championship for 2 years before starting work as V8 pit reporter late in '98. He was a part of Ten's V8 coverage for almost 10 years - even hosting and anchoring the commentary on occasions.  During this period the station won numerous Logie Awards for its broadcast of the famous Bathurst 1000 and Rusty developed a reputation as a pit specialist also working on the Gold Coast Champ Car race and the Australian Formula One Grand Prix in Melbourne. Despite an offer to join the Seven Network in 2007, Rust stayed with Ten to front the station's MotoGP and F1 broadcasts and its long running magazine motorsport show RPM.

            "The semantic meaning of the Arabic term jihād has no relation to holy war or even war in general. It derives, rather from the root j.h.d., the meaning of which is to strive, exert oneself, or take extraordinary pains. Jihād is a verbal noun of the third Arabic form of the root jahada, which is defined classically as \"\"exerting one's utmost power, efforts, endeavors, or ability in contending with an object of disapprobation.\"\" 14 Such an object is often categorized in the literature as deriving from one of three sources: a visible enemy, the devil, and aspects of one's own self. There are, therefore, many kinds of jihād, and most have nothing to do with warfare. \"\"Jihād of the heart,\"\" for example, denotes struggle against one's own sinful inclinations, while \"\"jihād of the tongue\"\" requires speaking on behalf of the good and forbidding evil. 15 ...\n",

            "... Muhammad is also credited with saying: \"\"The best jihād is [speaking] a word of justice to a tyrannical ruler.\"\" 17 The qualifying phrase \"\"in the path of God\"\" (fi sabīl Allah) specifically distinguishes the activity of jihād as furthering or promoting God's kingdom on earth. It can be done, for example, by simply striving to behave ethically and by speaking without causing harm to others or by actively defending Islam and propagating the faith. Jihād as religiously grounded warfare, sometimes referred to as \"\"jihād of the sword\"\" (jihād al-sayf), is subsumed under the last two categories of defending Islam and propagating the faith, though these need not be accomplished only through war. When the term is used without qualifiers such as \"\"of the heart\"\" or \"\"of the tongue,\"\" however, it is universally understood as war on behalf of Islam (equivalent to \"\"jihād of the sword\"\"), and the merits of engaging in such jihād are described plentifully in the most-respected religious works. 18 Nevertheless, Muslim thinkers, and particularly ascetics and mystics, often differentiate between the \"\"greater jihād\"\" (al-jihād al-akbar) and the \"\"lesser jihād\"\" (al-jihād al-asghar), with the former representing the struggle against the self and only the \"\"lesser jihād\"\" referring to warring in the path of God. 19 \n",

Having said all that, inclusion of such info in the articles on the books themselves makes perfect sense, and if it can be established that there was a degree of personal contact between an author and an illustrator, that could be referenced in the article too.

The system with Swedish military designations are not exclusive to aircraft or engines and have been the same since long before there were aircraft. This goes back to at least the 19th century, probably more. This is something I became aware of long time ago after spending hours digging in archives doing researches for numerous books and magazine articles about Swedish aviation history over the years. Why do you think it's SK 60 and not SK60 in the aricle(or even worse the Americanized SK-60)? The designation system is the same for Army bases, Air Force bases, Navy bases, radar, cameras, robots, airplanes, vehicles, guns, actually anything that goes into an inventory list including engines both piston and jets! Military systems anywhere are not exactly known for being flexible. Everything should be conformed the same. It should be the same with Wikipedia. If we want to spell the engine designation incorrect, then the airplane designation has to be changed to the incorrect \"\"SK60\"\" as well!

This contrary evidence and contradiction in Zimmerman's story should be noted in this wiki article.

El Dorado was supposedly a city with a king who wore gold in South America, while the Fountain of Youth was pursued by Ponce de Leon in Florida while he was collecting slaves for the Spanish plantations of the Caribbean.  I am not sure which the author meant, but given the fact that this was on the same continent as the supposed Fountain of Youth, I am going to delete the reference to El Dorado & leave the Fountain of Youth.

Even if you grant the forger enough expertise in Photoshop to cunningly so randomly \"\"age\"\" the documents to the point that you can not replicate most at all with a modern word processor , as well as make him/her an exceedingly diligent researcher who carefully culled through all the DoD records to gather up convincing content minutia to a detail that exceeded greatly what bloggers and the even media could pick up on (including a reference to the now redacted James Bath, who was suspended exactly one month after Bush , you still have a couple of issues: 1) someone so brilliant would very likely have been smart enough to have used some old typewriter like the still easy to find Selectric to create the forgeries; and 2) you still have that Feb. 2nd, 1972, memo  with the reference to Bush and Bath having some sort of flight certification issues  information that could only have been derived by an analysis of Bush's flight logs, but which were not released until AFTER CBS had obtained all the memos. Those flight logs had not been available for over 30 years, and even then, likely only to Bush's superiors in the Air Guard/USAF. The pro-forgery claims may start as a big pile, but item by item, it shrinks down to nothing under close scrutiny. The \"\"they are real\"\" pile starts off a bit smaller, but even after you take out CBS's incompetent, dumbass handling of them, there is still a pile left. Like I said, it is what it is, and you should think instead really long and hard about what this all means, especially in regards to the way the White House dodged answering questions about them, as in the \"\"answer\"\" given to \"\"Stephen, from Colorado Springs, CO\"\" here. I always find it interesting how Dan Bartlett fields the question there, and how he gets mentioned and described in this long interview of Burkett there seems to be a certain \"\"consistency\"\" in behavior.

However, Kosovo is nowhere treated as an entity indistinct from Serbia (and most definatly not indistinct from the S-M), as no faction in the world sees it that way. I suggest that a possible compromise is that we should add that the Kosovar Albanian goverment refuses the Belgrade suzeiranity and considers it not a part of Serbia, and then the other side of the story (Serbia & the world), however, pointing it not an official part of Serbia and Montenegro is, francly, I apologize for the expression, but it is, really nonsensical.

            "This letter is intended as a kind of vaccine, an inoculation if you will, against the lies that permeate Amaury's jokes. The rest of this letter is focused exclusively on Amaury, not because I harbor any ill-will towards him but because he likes values that subordinate principles of fairness to less admirable criteria. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that to believe that his opinions represent the opinions of the majority—or even a plurality—is to deceive ourselves. I undeniably profess that he rewards those who show scrupulous adherence to his worldview and punishes those who make his adversarial contrivances understood, resisted, and made the object of deserved contempt by young and old alike. Deal with it.\n",
            "\n",

If we can understand what has caused the current plague of vindictive despots, I believe that we can then help people see his bloody-minded epithets for what they are. Time cannot change Amaury's behavior. Time merely enlarges the field in which Amaury can, with ever-increasing intensity and thoroughness, take a condescending cheap shot at a person whom most arrogant sectarians will never be in a position to condescend to. He demands absolute and blind obedience from his encomiasts. If he didn't, they might question his orders to create a beachhead for organized warlordism. This unrelenting demand of obedience also implies that you don't need me to tell you that this is not wild speculation. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is documented fact.\n",

            "This is not to say that Amaury seems to enjoy making unfounded statements and jumping to conclusions. It is merely to point out that Amaury exhibits an overweening sense of entitlement and a predilection for depreciating others. So don't feed me any phony baloney about how he has a duty to conceal the facts and lie to the rest of us, under oath if necessary, perjuring himself to help disseminate the True Faith of conspiracism. That's just not true. There is a format he should follow for his next literary endeavor. It involves a topic sentence and supporting facts. If hidebound grafters really believed in equality, they wouldn't control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind. If you doubt this, just ask around. I'd like to end this letter with a message for Amaury. I'd like to say with emphasis and distinctness—not as a threat, but as a warning—that I will do whatever it takes to bring important information about Amaury's moonstruck, demented long-term goals into the limelight, and I won't let Amaury stop me from achieving that goal.\n",

For f  M → N a smooth map, there is usually not a smooth bundle map from T*N to T*M (unless f is a diffeomorphism). There is a pointwise map of individual cotangent spaces f*p  Tf(p) N → Tp M for every p, defined by operation with the pushforward of a vector in the corresponding tangent space (it is the transpose of the pushfoward on individual tangent spaces). But for the general point q in N we can't pull back to M unless we have a way of choosing a point in f-1(q) (which is especially problematic if f is not onto...). However, we can pull back sections of the cotangent bundle (i.e. covector field, and this applies in general to covariant tensor fields). The \"\"pullback\"\" everyone talks about is a map from covector fields on N to covector fields on M, that is, given ω: N → T*N a section, we define f*ω  M → T*M  by\n",

It has been remarked in several books that the co-objects seem to have this wonderful extra structure, of being able to pull back sections.

Lot of famous scientist of the era tried to made the mathematical background of the Q.theory but its proved to difficult for them. Neumann redefinied the definitions, he pointed out serials of former serious errors. He made Q. theory to a calculable science which made it a practicable science for industry. He invented the famous game theory and designed the world-famous ENIAC digital computer too.(ENIAC, short for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer,[1][2] was the first general-purpose electronic computer. It was a Turing-complete, digital computer capable of being reprogrammed to solve a full range of computing problems.[3] ENIAC was designed to calculate artillery firing tables for the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, but its first use was in calculations for the hydrogen bomb. When ENIAC was announced in 1946 it was heralded in the press as a \"\"Giant Brain\"\". It boasted speeds one thousand times faster than electro-mechanical machines, a leap in computing power that no single machine has since matched. This mathematical power, coupled with general-purpose programmability, excited scientists and industrialists.) Neumann was the main mathematican in Manhattan Project. Other famous Hungarian was Jenő Wigner often reffered as the father of quantum mechanics. Other famous Hungarian: Leó Szilárd his invention changed the basis of nuclear science:  he invented the nuclear chain reaction and invented the nuclear reactor (and he invented with Wigner the first nuclear power station) as well as the first Particle accelerator. Therefore the nuclear physics became a practicable/utilizable science for mankind. As the inventor nuclear chain reaction, he realised foremost the atomic-bomb, he made the basic \"\"Cutaway Drawing\"\" of the first atomic bomb. He asked Albert Einstein to write letter to president Roosevelt for the realization of a concrete nuclear Bomb. In Manhattan project dosens of scientist and hundreds of engineers worked for the realization of Szilárd's idea: a working atomic bomb from 1939-1944. An other Hungarian Ede Teller invented the H-bomb. And it is just particle quantum / nuclear physics. It is just a branch of physics.

            "Oddly enough, I am truly agnostic on this particular bit of software. It's always been my position that it should have a fair trial, but it seems that at every step things have been problematic.  First off, there was the fact it was introduced immediately on the heels of two other major UI changes (the addition of revision deletion to the admin toolkit, and the switchover to Vector).  Then there was the fact that the version on the test wiki was *not* the version to be introduced here, so nobody could even test it properly on the testwiki.  The trial criteria were not developed until just days before the trial itself, and there were no benchmarks set to determine whether or not there was any change over time, or whether that change was positive or negative. The majority of early supporters in the original PC poll wanted it to be focused on BLPs, but for some reason at the end of the poll it was decided that PC should be applied to currently protected or semi-protected articles instead, and those were the articles targeted in the trial. The WMF press on the subject specifically referred to the ability for anonymous and newly-registered users to edit long-time semi-protected articles of high profile topics (the George W. Bush article was specifically mentioned), without discussing this in advance with the community. (It lasted less than 2 days on pending changes, with mountains of vandalism during that period.) Then there was the promise by the lead developer that PC would be shut off at the end of 60 days unless the community clearly requested otherwise. Four days later, when lead developer responsibility changed hands, the new lead developer announced that he would rather keep things running during any review, on a quiet page with only the most interested editors watching.  Even with all of this disarray, I still hoped that we could get a reasonable trial of the tool. It was agreed that we'd start off with 2000 articles in the trial, starting with just a few and ramping up so that we'd hit the 2K articles around 2 weeks into the trial, with the expectation that if things went well, we'd add more incrementally, perhaps up to 10K; however, only a handful of administrators participated in adding articles to the trial, and I don't think we ever got above 1500.  Further, at that point, we'd pretty well added all of the articles that were eligible under the criteria for the trial, except for ones in categories where one or more administrator had objected to inclusion; as best I can tell, their objections were based on the articles being honey pots for socks.  I was one of the most active admins in adding articles to the trial, and I confess I sneaked in a pile of BLPs that technically didn't meet the criteria (they had been semi-protected in the previous 6 months and had fewer than 10 watchers). Indeed, one of the most telling factors on this trial was the fact that very, very few administrators appeared to be interested in using the tool as currently configured. I also note that the time that it has taken edits to be reviewed has continued to lengthen as time has gone on. A few weeks ago, I led a panel on the topic of Pending changes at the New York City Wiki-conference. Thanks to DGG, Becksguy and Jamesofur, who were also on the panel.   That same day, keynote speaker Clay Shirky talked about the fact that once a culture is \"\"broken\"\", it is not able to rebound back to its prior state. In my own closing statement, I reflected on that comment, and wondered if pending changes might be the \"\"culture-breaker\"\" for Wikipedia and, if it was, whether or not that would be a good or bad thing. Certainly the manner in which this entire trial has proceeded has shown that there are some pretty huge differences in what people perceive as the way we do things around here. I don't think  the pending changes software or its use will be the culture breaker, but the manner in which it is being integrated and promoted into the project might very well be. I am very considerably concerned that this pressure to keep a bit of trial software running has resulted in a level of divisiveness between good-faith Wikipedians from which the community may not recover.     \"\n",

There are some sources here that support the idea that various types of nuclear power have been considered as sustainable, but that wasn't the only reason the IPs edits were reverted. This is one reason tying this into the above discussion is a bad idea, because this isn't just about the academic consensus on a loosely defined \"\"type of nuclear fission\"\". Using the article to explain in context that nuclear power is in some ways sustainable, according to some points of view, would be fine. The edits introduced large quantities relatively weakly sourced material to present nuclear as being a primary and uncontroversial source of sustainable energy. The above sources support mentioning nuclear as one aspect of sustainability. They do not warrant altering the article to make nuclear energy the first specific section, nor do they warrant excessive ref-bombing to support that perspective, while using similarly selective tactics to undermine those who hold a more critical perspective. This isn't just about verifiability, this is also about WP:WEIGHT. Even the sources presented here indicate that nuclear's sustainability is under-researched and hinges on too many unknowns to be accepted without further comment. This is true for many areas of sustainable energy research, but especially nuclear. It is an active area of research (or areas, rather) which has a relatively small but extremely vocal core of active supporters. This should not be used to diminish that perspective or the potentially revolutionary research, but major context was being selectively left-out from the proposed edits.   \"\n",

Her mother is a professional and has worked for the government for almost 30 years and her father is retired.   Traci was raised on staage at the age of 2 starting with ballet then tap, then jazz.... she was a natural on stage..... throughout her childhood she was in pagaents and sport like softball, volleyball and track in high school, she competed in many events: Miss Wright State of OHIO,All American Drill Team.\n",
            "\n",
            "After Traci graduated, her love of dance and people took her to a business college, where she studied basics in business management.  Then she learned ins and outs of banking and later took on another degree in Medical Techology. She also did promotional work for , bartended , ran local bars and competed in bikini contests for extra funds.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 1996, Traci started lifting weights with a friend and saw a photo of Marla Duncan winning a national competition. Her beauty and physique impressed her enough that she wanted to try what she was doing - Fitness Competitions. At the time she was developing some problems medically and noticed herself gaining some weight.   Traci thought weight training would help but she found that because she is a natural she responded almost imediately to the weights which caused her to get pretty stocky and very strong quick.  She was still eating normally but when it comes to bikini contests you need to be lean and feminine.... well this is when the Army Soldiers took a noticed to her.  She was at Ft. Hood, TX and was left alone because a lot of times soldiers are away for months to years and she was pretty shy meeting others because she had always been very much independent.  So she decided to check out while in studies some competitions related to the Army.  This is where she found out about obstacles course contests... so she knew she was strong and stocky so maybe this would be better for her.  So she entered her first WTF competition with little or know training and out of 100 girls made nationals in top 10. but something happened ... she started noticing her weight wasn't changing and she was developing back problems and fatigue.   She had always had problems with being healthy as a kid and seemed to get sick a lot.  Her Father was always on her about bundling up.  One day her discomfort and taken so much that she ended up in the emergency room... this is when she found that her bowels had backed up into her system and she was lucky because if was really serious... the only time she had ever dealt with hospitals is with her hearing... she had lost her hearing at four along with being sick all the time... and at 17 had to have implants put in which was a miracle cause it gave her 80% back... but she is still considered hearing impaired... now this is happening to her... she had gained a weight up to 180 and looked very stocky... the doctors didn't know what was wrong with her.... she spent three days being detoxed so to speak... when they didn't know if she had lupus, rheumatoid, but later found traces of cancer in her colon... but she didn't let it get her down. So she reenrolled in school again for more college degrees towards nutrition in NC.   Up until 2002 she only competed for fun, not as a money making career. In 2002 she was honored with several titles in many organizations like Hawaiian Tropic, Venus, Ms Fitness and Sport Aerobics and WTF.. it wasn't til she had heard she was on ESPN2 every month for one year and honored on the front page of her local newspaper and found herself in several articles in OXYGEN. This helped Traci realize that she had potential to earn some actual money in the fitness industry. She kept competing and in April of '2002 moved to an organization which she had heard was tough and very different from others called NPC /IFBB.  This is where Arnold S. Slyvester Stalone and many more came out of you know the BOYS CLUB Once she arrived, competing in her first NPC she had found a very different way they handled threi shows and treated the competitors... Shoop coming from a strong female in charge background family life saw that this was going to be a challenge for her... she had dreamed of maybe getting more exposure and getting the chance to really be friends with some of the hollywood celebrities.  During the time she was studying nutriiton she always had more than several ideas and projects in mind to bring to the future.... now she has alwsy felt competing natural was always her best route and found with no help and little support she was able to conquer her enemies and achieve her goals.  She was always wnadering why thes other girls who seemed to get covers and major sponsors did it... where she found herself funding everything on her little $7 an hour because she as a military spouse never made as much in those cities because the husband was the provider she was tired of the little she wanted bigger she knew that s\n",

I believe that, properly and historically, the 'Styles' really refer only to the 'Start of Year' change (from March 25th to January 1); and that the 'Leap Year'  change should be described as the change from Julian to Gregorian.\"\"Spathaky, Mike Old Style New Style dates and the change to the Gregorian calendar. \"\"increasingly parish registers, in addition to a new year heading after 24th March showing, for example '1733', had another heading at the end of the following December indicating '1733/4'.

That the title is questionable in its honesty because as he shows at the top of the discussion page, following his prevuious pattern he should have used the less offensive title Judaism by country. And finally, the figures which he has published do not come from the listed reference pages as he infers but have been generated by himself by multiplying the est. 2005 populations by the rough percentage numbers for the countries.\n",

Nor do any of the reputable sources pretend to give percise religious numbers to six or eight digit accuracy. In fact, checking the references you quickly discover that the 2001 Australian census gave the figure of 84,000 people who marked Judaism as their religion. That all other real estimates are based upon adjustments to that figure, as is discussed on this page I found by a Christian Research Association. I finally did a Google searchon his claimed figure to discover that Wikipedia is the only publication claiming such a figure. So I finally submit that this article relects badly upon Wikipedia and adds no meaningful value beyond the fine work already done in Jewish population.

The hope is that errors will be quickly caught and corrected.\"\".. Marketing professor Peter Fader notes that Wikipedia shows there is wisdom in crowds, but a better user rating system would filter out those who post bogus information. Joel Waldfogel, professor of business and public policy, agrees that much of the concern about Wikipedia is just a new spin on whether old media (printed encyclopedias, in this case) stand a chance against the new breed of instantly updatable online media. (quoted from article). In short, no matter what system you come up with here, it is going to be wisdom of the crowd, by design, that is what Wiki is. So you might as well design a system around that concept, go with the natural design of the system, work with it to all its advantages, not work against it and try to limit it with \"\"old media\"\" concepts.  \n",

They just explained their issues, which were socioeconomic and ethnic issues. In addition, James Miles states: \"\"The rioting seemed primarily an eruption of ethnic hatred.\"\",which I'm guessing he had to interview many rioters/residents to ask them about it. And rather, I don't think the Rodney King article is worded very well- it should be changed, but I'm guessing many people are already well-informed of the real reasons for those riots, unlike this riot where few seem to understand- including you! And, come on now, you're obviously just picking at straws to try to twist the article. All evidence so far points to the rioters looting and beating ethnic Han chinese out of hatred, not because they want to separate or they would've attacked much more government buildings rathern than focussing on the stores of more wealthy Chinese people.

As far as I am aware, Gwen Gale had no prior involvement in the page or the section concerned. Certainly, I had never seen her name in any of the page history. Unless it constituted a grave breach of some other policy, which not even Gwen Gale has claimed, any possible deletion should have been discussed beforehand and not executed summarily. To quote the BLP policy  “Biographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified; if this is not possible, then it should be removed.”\n",

As will be shown in what follows the text did not violate either of these policy documents. Gwen Gale refused multiple specific requests to quote the exact passages of the Biography on Living Persons or Verifiability policies which she claimed had been violated. This refusal to properly discuss a summary deletion is against Wikipedia conduct guidelines and not acceptable behaviour in an Administator.\n",

            "\"Hip-Hop Is NOT Dead But Ready To \"\"Get It\"\"!!! (Calif) Hip-hop producer and west coast native E. Re-ill debuts his album “Get It”. “Get It” is the representation of E. Re-ill's mindset, \"\"I'm in a place in my life where I need to become who I am... I got to “Get It”!!! says E. Re-ill. “Get It” is an album that when focused on can bring out the drive in you to make your dreams real. Why you may ask? You need three things to achieve your goals Hope (expectations), Hustle (drive) and Hunger (appetite for success). These three mindsets are displayed in this album which accompanied by your dreams this will enable your inner being to ““Get It”!” E. Re-ill has been producing beats since the late 80's, influenced by Dr. Dre (and who isn't), Rick Rubin, performed with many stars, and has participated in great projects. A prior and classic venture was with the street-ball company Y.P.A. and the DVD titled \"\"The War\"\". E. Re-ills’ most rememberable time in making music is when N.W.A. was filming the classic controversial video \"\"Straight Outta Compton\"\" E. Re-ill's older brother caught the attention of Ice Cube and filmed Ice Cube telling E. Re-ill to keep up and he'll see him on top!!! That statement would drive E.Re-ill for many years. Hip-Hop has always been the “in touch with your inner voice” music and then we have always informed our community of how we see the actions displayed in front of us. Hip-Hop can be fun, dark, and everything in between. However, usually no matter the topic a hip-hop song it should captivate you!!! “Get It” is no exception to this, “Get It” displays emotional drive, creative sound packages, consistent vibe and sounds, and arguably some of the best lyrics delivered on hip-hop tracks in a long while. Songs like \"\"Dark People\"\" a description of pushing your self to great heights even when life shorts you of opportunities. \"\"I'm So Gangsta\"\" is a nice surprise!!! It is Fresh Caesar's look at the world biggest gangsta George Bush, and his fumbles with war and Katrina!!! Don't cheat yourself I'm so Gangsta is a necessary download!!! Oakland native and a brilliant lyricist Fresh Caesar (a.k.a. Omega) is currently working on his own album titled \"\"Jack London’s Square\"\". Fresh Caesar displays lyrical strengths of Nas and Jay-Z with a west coast flavor delivery. Fresh Caesar displays great lyrical ability and is definitely not your average rapper on the mic. Down South/Oakland rapper, Tom-E-Gunn has the sounds of Snoop Dogg's early gangsta swag with grit of the south. These songs are actually lost demos recently found. E. Re-ill felt compelled to use the demos for the world to hear due to their strong delivery of life experiences. E. Re-ill's “Get It” album is about all the aspirations that we desire in life money, success, respect, reflections of life, and excess of women and parties. This is the start of great things to come from this talented producer. iTunes search E.Re-ill (no spaces), Contact: myspace.com/ereill1 Also available on rhapsody, emusic, napster, Amazon...\"\n",

The trial, which has received extensive cover in the media, deals with issues for which BP has already pleaded guilty, and faces fine of up to $20 billion. The presence of other articles is immaterial. This is a very serious trial, and it behooves us to mention it to readers, and state what is at stake.

You can read the relevant policy at WP:WAX. \n",

            "First of all have you compared the Merkavas dimensions with the other tanks??? What you wrote here was rubbish. All the main battle tanks in the world are not air mobile capable: No helo designed or in service anywhere in the world can carry them. Nor can they be parachuted...too heavy. All these MBT's including the Merkava, can fit aboard the C-5 Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster air transports to be airlifted anywhere on the globe. The Merkava Mk 4 has a 1500hp GD833 Diesel Engine and additional armor, especially up top, for urban battlefields. Ever been to the Holy land? You get all types of terrain there, not the stereotypical desert/arabian landscape that is always seen on TV. There are forests and swamps in Israel, and up north the terrain is especially rough and it snows too. What consensus are you talking about? Israel has had more battlefield experience with the use of armor and armored warfare in general than any country on this planet. The weight of the Merkava Mk 4 is approximately the same as the M1A2SEP. It has more crew protection than the Leopard tank and has an active self-defense system. It also retains the 60mm Mortar which can be fired under armor. BATTLEFILED MOBILITY of the Merkava series of tanks is better than both the M1 and the Leopard. It is true that both tanks are faster than the Merkava but the Merkava was designed with emphasis on crew protection, survivability and firepower, over speed. The Merkava is more survivable in a firepower-saturated environment meaning it can go places the M1 and Leopard cannot. For this reason the Merkava has more freedom to maneuver, which gives more options to it's operators and commanders, and allows more aggressive courses of action. The enemy cannot simply deny areas to the Merkavas by firepower, meaning the Israeli tank has better battlefield mobility than the Abrams and Leo 2.\n",

Indian or Spectacled cobras (Naja naja) of course have two ocelli or eyespot markings on the back of their hood.  (These are thought to serve as \"\"eyes in the back of the head,\"\" with the adaptive function of deterring predators that might try to attack the standing cobra from behind).

            "Kristof the problem here is a lag from the old Ukrainian orthography that has since changed. A similar case existed in Belarus, but much more amplified, when the changes of 1930s and subsequent orthographic reforms were very noticeable it affected the way whole cities were spelled. Example Minsk and Mensk. In fact that is the reason why there are two versions of Belarusian edition wikipedia, one uses the old and the other the official adopted version. In Ukrainian language a similar happened but to lesser extent, and only some cities were affected e.g. Rivne became Rovno, Luhanske became Luhansk, Konotip became Konotop and so on. With our city as far as I am aware it too became Мукачево. During the 1990s some of those changes were reversed, and it really falls to because in Ukrainian there are sufficient differences between dialects, in fact if you compare western and central Ukrainian the differences would be more vivid than that of British and American English. So for some cases like Rivne, it was much up to the locals, because Volhynian dialect pronounces the city like its spelled, whilst somewhere in Poltava they will say it as Rovno. It seems that with Mukhachevo it is a case that the version used by locals is not entirely adopted nationwide. But then again there are some silly people in the government who use spellings such as Sevatopil but that is outright stupid, because even in classic orthography that version would never be used. The -pil originates from the connotation of field like Ternopil. The -pol comes from the Greek root for city, like Sevastopol. All the more reasons why we should stick to Mukachevo and help to leave the archaic spelling where it belongs in history.\n",

It will also depend on how their lines are set up on how reliant they are on manual labor (on cell production lines at large manufacturers I think you will find little reliance on manual labor in either country). But regardless, a tariff would push PV prices up just as they're finally beginning to come down. I don't that's a good idea. I also don't think it would have the desired effect. I don't have any figures on how much PV the US imports from China, but some 3.5% of US PV exports go to China. Furthermore, the US is still a net exporter of PV modules so for a tariff to have the desired effect I think it would have to be levied by some other government that is more significant to the Chinese PV industry.\n",

However, your approach is raising some hackles. I'd suggest discussing your concerns further on the article talk pages and trying to reach some sort of consensus about how to better present the mainstream view of EMF-related health issues. Tirades, however justified they may feel, are counterproductive in the long run.

So effectively they feel they're not independent but under occupation (or if you don't like the word, under the \"\"control\"\" of Turkey).  Back to the issue, the Nicosia article should have the same information/structure as the Cyprus article. In fact the the TRNC (or the occupation for that matter) isn't even mentioned in the Cyprus infobox. That's why North Cyprus exists. We have to be consistent.

I know when something messed up is noted on another site and people here are made aware of it there's usually an effort to fix it.  That happened in this case, but the guardians of the Obama page made sure nothing changed.  So be it. If it upsets and embarasses you as it does me, do something to fix it.   \"\n",

            "Note that a planet gravitationally locked to its star will have tidal heating like Io, so it's not as if everything will freeze on the night side. The great advantage of a grav-locked planet is its stability. I think it's fair to say that stability is easier for life to deal with than instability. If you look at the stability of Jupiter's great red spot (400 years and posited to be permanent), weather on a grav-locked planet should be relatively stable, I presume a convection rising at the \"\"sun pole\"\" and falling at the \"\"dark pole\"\", with terrain eddies, of course. Such a planet will have no axial tilt, no day/night cycleI don't even think it can have an eccentric orbit, but I'm unsure. This greatly reduces the complexity of an organism's job: for example a plant doesn't need the night \"\"mode\"\" earth plants need; they would not have to drop leaves for winter. These seem like advantages to me.\n",

            "Based on the best information I can find on the US Dept. of Energy site (solar information), what plants get on a clear equinox day is about 8 kWH/m^2, peaking at 1 kW/m^2. The vast majority of that power comes in the middle 8 hours, less than 1 kWH/m^2 is in morning and evening. The night is essentially 0 kWH/m^2not absolutely, no, but to the 2 digit accuracy I was using, yes. (Compare visual magnitudes of sun vs. moon.) This varies by latitude and season, of course. Now let's plug this into the supposedly horrible 60-200% variation of a red dwarf. Instead of roughly 1/3 time at 1 kW (yes, it really is close to that), equivalent energy would be all the time at 1/3 kW. Thus, the variation would be 1/5 kW during minimums (=60% of 1/3 kW) and, of course, 200% is 2/3 kW. Thus, ignoring frequency, the red dwarf plant has an easier time. The lower power of red dwarfs just pull the HZ in. Considering Earth shade plants, which live on far less than 1 kW/m^2, the HZ is where the total solar and gravitational energy are right for water.\n",

One was given to the Inquisitor, one to the King of England, and one to the Bishop of Beauvais. This Process was made from a certain Minute written in French, by my own hand, which was given up to the Judges, and was afterwards translated from the French into Latin by Monsieur Thomas de Courcelles and myself, in the form in which it now stands, as well and as faithfully as possible, long after the death and execution of Jeanne. As for the Act of Accusation and other parts of the Process, Maitre Thomas de Courcelles had very little to do with these, nor did he greatly interfere with them. \n",

I complained of this, saying it was irregular, and that I would not be responsible, as clerk, in this matter: and, therefore, on the morrow, the place of meeting was changed and convened in a certain hall of the Castle, near the Great Hall, while two English were placed to keep order. When there were difficulties as to Jeanne's answers, and some said she had not replied as I had written, I wrote Nota at the top, in order that the questions might be repeated and the difficulties removed. Although it is mentioned in the Process that the Judges stated they had received preliminary evidence, I do not remember to have seen or heard of it; but I know that, if it had been produced, it would have been inserted in the Process. \n",

He replied, that the Process was of no value, and could not be maintained, because it was conducted in the Castle and not in a legal court; that it concerned many who were not summoned; that Jeanne had no Counsel: and for many other reasons. He added that, in his opinion, it was their intention to put her to death. \n",

At that time, Germany was a fairly religious state. To sum it up: I believe there was some editor here that wanted to make modern Germany look bad by applying non neutral wording and some unverified claims. The german version of this article seems much better and (logically) is checked much more often than this one. I suggest either having someone who not only read the whole Grundgesetz, but also has significant political and historical knowlege check this article for further inaccuracies or using the german version, which I believe is often checked by people who know the subject, to check this one through.

At the same time, the internet is bulging at the seams with information showing that Detroit is where Techno was birthed. Certainly, Europe has adopted Techno as it's own, more than America or even Detroit ever has or did, but unless we can get some REAL citations going we need to remove, what I see as, the wishful editing claims that Techno began in Western Europe. We REQUIRE citations. I'm honestly pretty neutral in this, I enjoy techno, but I prefer other genres. I just happened to stumble across the article, read the first sentence and checked the \"\"citation\"\" for the Western Europe claim (as it was news to me) and was sent to a dead page. I searched \"\"techno origins\"\" and found numerous pages saying Detroit birthed techno and added those cites. The evidence is just flat out contradictory to what some editors (wish to) believe. Honestly I do not care, but if Wikipedia is to be a reliable source, we as a community must be honest with what the facts are, or provide evidence (in citations) for alternate claims. I won't be doing any further edits in this article, I'll leave this one alone, I can sense this could turn ugly real quick, so I leave it to people who care more than I do.

I think that now we've moved on from the efforts to exclude a source through (wrong) application of the Notability guidelines we're left with Neutrality of Point of View as the main issue. Wikipedia reports what is out there and a decision to exclude entirely from an article an appropriate source which has a view on much that is in the article (as well as topics the article excludes) appears to be a bias. The idea that the only book of lit crit on Beedle the Bard has nothing whatsoever to add to an encyclopaedia article on the topic is incredible. I don't think COIN is central to the issue as it now stands; rather the central issue is NPV. I think there are wider issues which it would be interesting to discuss - for example had my username not been essentially my real name a post on the talk page a year ago saying \"\"hi guys, this book exists and has something to say about the article\"\" would not have generated this negative discussion. I suggest MedCab is a way forward because it can consider all issues, while COIN considers only one issue and probably one which is not central.   \"\n",

Since this was during the Federation (1960, if I remember correctly) I would infer that the Federation was not independent.  Other than that I just have negative proof - that I have never heard of an independence ceremony (which, if it had happened would have been in Trinidad, since the Federal capital was there) and the fact that most of the islands reverted to being British possessions after dissolution.\n",

There is an overview of the history of Reflex in the 20th anniversary issue, I'll try to expand the article with that information and answer your questions. Btw, Reflex is sometimes really considered as a conservative magazine; could there be a little difference between the perception of the term in the professional and well-developed Anglo-American journalism and the perception of still \"\"young\"\" independent Czech journalism? Using of this term in the post-communist world is quite complicated, as conservatism defends traditional values and continuity, and the first free post-communist media (including Reflex) had to start building again; to some extent they had to find the values and the interrupted tradition. The provocative cannabis award could be an attempt to test the borders of freedom of speech and to come closer to independent and bold journalism. This is, however, just my vague point of view. We should probably avoid this association on English Wikipedia, as this is a world grown in a completely different tradition and experience. Again, thanks for pointing out the problems.

The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.  \n",

In true video source material, the even field displays a time slice that is 20 milliseconds later than the odd field and the two together give a comlete video frame.  This is also largely true in the Americas, except the even field precedes the odd field by ~16.6 miliiseconds.\n",

            "There is a largish group of enthusiasts (if that's the right word) who have become somewhat anally retentive over the progressive video formats and who have convinced themselves that progressive is the only way to go.  The reality is that any improvement in the visual perception of the video is marginal at best and certainly not worth the doubling of the required digital data to support it.  But for them, everything has to be progressive.  I shall coin the word 'progressivists' for this discussion.\n",

            "When film originated material is transferred to video in Europe, the film is run slightly fast by 4% which allows one film frame to occupy both the the odd and even fields of the video frame (known as 2:2 pulldown).  Thus the even field displays a time slice that is 0 milliseconds later than the odd field.  In order to satisfy the progressivists, the Blu-Ray producers state that such material is in 1080p format, but using something called a 'Progressive Segmented Frame' technique (though they don't mention that last bit on the box).  That is: that it is progressive video, but the odd lines have been recorded together and then they are followed by the even lines.  It is really interlaced video, but by the time the display device or the Blu-ray player has de-interlaced the video (it doesn't matter one jot where it actually happens), the result is perceptually indistinguishable from true 1080/25p video (assuming the deinterlacing algorithm works properly).  If watched on a CRT display then, of course, the video will be interlaced as there is no deinterlacing prior to display, but with that number of lines, no one is likely to notice (unless they sit inches away from the screen).  The description 1080p on the box is, technically at least, wrong but percetually the same as 1080/25p video.  The 4% speed up goes completely un-noticed especially these days when the sound is adjusted back to the original pitch - and obviously you hadn't noticed it yourself if you had convinced yourself that you were watching films at the original speed.\n",

            "Once we cross to the Americas, different problems occur.  Obviously, running the film at 30 frames per second is not an option, so instead, film is converted to video by storing the same film frame on 3 half video frames, followed by storing the next frame on 2 half video frames and then repeating 3 - 2 - 3 - 2.  Thus 4 film frames occupy 5 video frames (the technique is 3:2 pulldown - often wrongly called 2:3 pulldown).  Properly deinterlaced, such material is perfectly watchable and the viewer unlikely to feel anything is wrong.  But the progressivists have decided that it is not the way to watch film material and have even invented faults to justify a move to a progressive format.  I have even seen claims (obviously failing to understand the technique) that movement in the resultant video is uneven in that it jumps 50% further every other jump due to the 3 half fields.  \n",

This is because automakers feed the press a lot of BS (Boastful Superlatives) who then work hard to write articles adding even more BS to describe their products. The press earns credits from the hands that feed them. Add to this the fact that potential and actual purchasers of luxury vehicles have an insatiable  appetite  for this type of BS. Classifying a particular vehicle as \"\"luxury\"\" is also designed to easily make it superior to other vehicles even if the differences are superficial. Using self-serving BS in marketing claims is a very, very old invention that helps sell products, as well as fuel the fan base with \"\"bragging\"\" rights to which vehicles are \"\"luxury\"\". On the other hand, it is more difficult for most marketers to be humble and genuine.

If, however, a consensus can be reached about how to phrase it as introductory material in a meaningful way, whatever language is chosen can be maintained with an occasional checkup on the language by the participating editors.  In my figuring of it, the way it was written before was a bit clumsy and largely indefensible on the basis that we'd already said it effectively, because we hadn't quite said it effectively in that paragraph.  I imagine there is some way of reasonably saying this in the article, as yet undetermined, that will ring true to those regular editors who understand the basic problem, and still explain reasonably well to the previously uninitiated reader of the material. Right now the first sentence of the paragraph is quite reasonable in my opinion (\"\"...Popper proposed the additional criterion of falsifiability\"\"), which factors in those theories that are dependent on coherence rather than outright falsifiability.

Begg wrote three treatises on this, most with all the same points, though successively in 1896, 1900 and 1902, all official reports with two (1896 and 1902) written to federal and provincial cabeint ministers, respectively.  Another item in Begg that's passed over here and in other histories is the Ukase of 1821 which claimed to 51 degrees N and also involved the Bering Sea Arbitration.  The Ukase looks to need its own article, as it also invovles the rights of the Russian Orthodox Church in the region.

            " Hi.  Indeed I'm in fault regarding those and some other images.  I haven't yet gotten around to them because I've had limited time to edit, which is worsened by the fact that the website keeps crashing every five minutes.  In the cases of those images, I got them in the special website setup by the Brazilian Olympic Committee during the 2004 Olympics.  The images published there had a promotional/divulgation purpose, and were not tagged with copyright disclaimers.  I believe that the website is gone now (will double check that though), but it was a very singular situation, since images such as those are usually the property of news agencies and/or photographers.  They were posted during the Olympics as part of a day-by-day coverage of the performance of Brazilian athletes in the games.  I will go about adding those explanations to each image's page asap.

In France, between 1985 and 1992, 100 patients who were being managed with fluoroquinolones had tendon disorders, which included thirty-one ruptures.(3) Worldwide the number of spontaneous tendon ruptures associated with the fluoroquinolone class has grown dramatically and in France alone the numbers had increased from 100 to 921 reported tendon disorders.(4) In a letter published in January 1995, based on similar reports found within the FDA files, including tendon ruptures occurring in the United States and other published articles, the FDA stated that the agency \"\"will update the labeling [package insert] for all marketed fluoroquinolones to include a warning about the possibility of tendon rupture.\"\"(5) But the FDA failed to do so for more than fourteen years after stating that they would in 1994.   \n",

On July 7, 2008, six months after Public Citizen filed their lawsuit in Federal Court, the FDA notified the makers of fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drugs for systemic use of the need to add a boxed warning to the prescribing information about the increased risk of developing tendinitis and tendon rupture in patients taking fluoroquinolones and to develop a Medication Guide for patients.(14) Kate Resnevic of Public Citizen stated on August 26, 2008 that “The FDA responded to our lawsuit by slapping fluoroquinolones with a black box warning - the strongest warning the FDA can request.”(15) The package inserts for Cipro, Avelox, Proquin XR, Factive, Floxin, Noroxin and Levaquin were changed on September 8, 2008 to reflect these new warnings.(16A, 16B) The new labels did not appear on the FDA site until November 2008.

The long online article authored by him, which I've began reading, already demonstrates that he's writing on conspiracism, a term which may or may not be a neologism (because it has not yet entered our dictionary). Nevertheless, we now this, that he means by it \"\"conspiracy theory,\"\" not that of a police detective investing the working of the Mafia, but that of someone who subscribes to a conspiracy in spite of all the inadequate evidence available which would justify a logical inference. In the article by whom to which I was directed by the editor herein, however, Barkun does not focus on a specific phenomena which he explicitly labels \"\"New World Order\"\" But I really did not read more that the beginning of his first series. That's partly due to the fact that I have little interest, or patience, for studying the sociology, or politics, of such phenomena. My interests lie in its history. I want to know who said or wrote what and when. Unfortunately, so fare I have not found that in the opening of that article of his in the series. What I find most interesting is the work of Robert Singerman, who is responsible for the Singerman list. This work gives one a great initial source to do precisely that. If or when I find that this article turns into some sort of analysis (supported by referenced scholarship of course) I will not want to participate here. However, if this is truly a mostly historical analysis of the NWO Conspiracy, I might want to stay on board. However, I still am in the clouds in comprehending whether this article is about a singular phenomena (as the name implies), or whether this is meant to be about some sort of collective. In either case, I still find myself inside a long tunnel without any light at the end.    \n",

The Caucasus article only says that the geo-political area is located \"\"at the border of Europe and Asia\"\". This is because the mountain range is usually considered to be the boundary between the Europe and Asia (see the sources I have previously provided). While Chechnya, Dagestan etc. are located on the northern side of the mountains, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia are located south of the mountains. This is reflected in the map used in the article Europe. The Eastern Europe article only says that the Caucasus states are \"\"sometimes\"\" included in Eastern Europe - \"\"sometimes\"\" is not the same as \"\"usually\"\", and the article includes this map based on UN sources. That map does not include the three transcaucasian states in Eastern Europe. While the map recognizes that the northernmost small portions of Azerbaijan and Georgia may be included, the capitals of those countries are not located in the said portions. In a similar fashion the CIA World Factbook uses this division of European sub-regions, and leaves the transcaucasian states out of it. The most important other Wikipedia article is the article \"\"Europe\"\", since this article's title is directly associated with it. And from this map you can see the prevailing definition of geopgraphic Europe used in Wikipedia. Regarding your last statement, Wikipedia policy demands discussion if the reverting of a version is called into question. Since you have now said that you do not intend to engage in further discussion and since you have declined to answer many of my arguments and questions, I have for my part fulfilled the expectation of proper procedure, and I can thus proceed to edit the article again.   \"\n",

As a place where classics meets the public, it was for many years almost unique, and certainly pioneering. I often find myself thinking how extraordinary it was for Bill Thayer, who wasn't born of the cyber-generation, to have seized so early on the concept that the internet could make these kinds of resources available to the public—and to assume a public existed for them. I benefitted so much from it when my daughter was little and I was home with her, and even though other resources have appeared, if I want a Loeb translation I'll always prefer LacusCurtius if it's available there, in the hope of some \"\"Thayer's Notes.\"\"  I used his texts to create my own annotated editions at a time when he was just about the only source for something like Pliny, whose chapter on gemstones, I may have confessed under torture before, I once spent a week perusing.

This site regards it as one of the \"\"best-loved and most heavily used online resources for Classics research,\"\" along with Perseus, which I'll do almost anything to avoid using, though it doesn't load as slowly as it used to, and sometimes I can even coax it to offer up text by the book instead of paragraph. \n",

So far, Cornerstone University has avoided peer pressure from higher education to embrace moral ambiguity.  The university has continued to support a pro-life philosophy consistent with Scripture, still believes the truth of the first three chapters of Genesis, and clearly does not accept homosexuality as just another alternative acceptable lifestyle.  This is an important biblical testimony in a time when higher education is populated by academicians more attuned to culture than the Word. \n",

            "Thanks - the first five years following my diagnosis i spent actively resarching what schizophrenia meant. it was first coined as 'the schizophrenias' by a humanist doctor as it was previously referred to as s kind of dementia - however it has assumed many negative connotations since. the link between autism and schizophrenia is a promising one as you couldnt possibly get two more diametrically opposed labels in terms of public perception. Some of the original schizophrenias were hebophrenia - from the greek god hebes associated with onset in adolescence , apophenia meaning relating one unconnected thing with another etc etc , however the name has become homogenized over the recent years - there are of course links with previous hypotheses such as the bicameral mind and up and coming theories such as 'unfocussed semantic activation in the right hemisphere of the brain'. i have made a FOIA request to the bbc regarding which WHO ICD classification each criminal that a news story was reported on with a diagnosis of schizophrenia in the previous six months had and recieved the response that they could not disclose this due to patient confidentiality unless it was reported in the open courts which was highly unlikely. i have forwarded their response to the research and information compliance dpeartment of the courts to ask them to consider this. i belive the next ICD classification is due to be released in 2011/2012 and i intend to continue my campaign for the change of this damaging label till then.

The law was designed to target shipping commerce and shipping companies based out of Victoria and Vancouver, which had dominated coastal shipping for years until the rush.

Szczerze mówiąc nie bardzo rozumiemy te zastrzeżenia. Może ze względu na ograniczoną znajomość niuansów j. angielskiego, a może ze względu na ograniczoną znajomość niuansów zasad samej Wikipedii amerykańskiej. Bylibyśmy bardzo wdzięczni, gdyby zechciał Pan po polsku w kilku zdaniach sprecyzować problem. Jest Pan polakiem i powinniśmy o to dbać, aby w świecie byli znani nie tylko polscy hydraulicy i \"\"piłkarze\"\", ale także nasi intelektualiści. W tej chwili w Wikipedii jest cały szereg notek biograficznych o np. różnych gwiazdeczkach porno i nikogo to nie razi i nikt tego nie kwestionuje ich \"\"notability\"\", natomiast notka o polskim pisarzu i wybitnym aforyście budzi Pana ostracyzm. Czy taka jest przyszłość Wikipedii? Nie wiem czy panu Majewskiemu brakuje do szczęścia notki w amerykańskiej Wikipedii, ale wiem, że nam Polakom przydałoby się na świecie trochę prestiżu związanego z naszymi wybitnymi twórcami. Jeśli nie zna Pan postaci pana Majewskiego wystarczy znaleźć na googlach informację o nim i jego twórczości. Jest na ten temat ok. 100 tysięcy stron internetowych, gdzie występuje jego twórczość. Osoba pana Majewskiego nie jest \"\"znana z tego, że jest znana\"\", tylko ze względu na jego twórczość aforystyczną i fotograficzną. Nie jest wprawdzie tak popularny w kręgach rozwrzeszczanych małolatów jak pani Doda - Rabczewska (podobno też członkini Mensy), ale w rankingu istotności twórczości w kręgach ludzi o ambicjach intelektualnych wygrywa. Wszystkie podane w notatce w Wikipedii fakty są prawdziwe i weryfikowalne w źródłach drukowanych, choćby w jego albumie \"\"Ephemeralness of Eternity\"\", który znajduje się m. in. w Bibliotece Kongresu US. Nota bene pan Majewski jest tak jak Pan członkiem Mensy i to także może Pan zweryfikować. Jest to dosyć bolesne, że Pan jako Polak podważa zasadność umieszczenia informacji o panu Majewskim w amerykańskiej Wikipedii. Umniejsza Pan bezzasadnie wiarygodność podanych przez nas źródeł w postaci książek oraz innych informacji na oficjalnych stronach różnych instytucji oraz rządowych.

The Jain texts you refer to seem to have been written around (very roughly) the same time as the popular notion of the invention of the catapult in 399 BCE.  This makes them quite similar in time frame with the Biblical source describing a catapult.  In both cases, these are people writing down oral histories that had been passed down for some time.  Oral histories are subject to rapid change over time, but once written down, become (somewhat) stable. \n",

This is also good indications that the popular 399 BCE claim of invention (which I think was written much much later than that so in my opinion probably suffers from similar oral history issues) is probably not correct.  It seems likely that everyone was probably claiming for a period of a least a hundred years and maybe more that their particular king or hero or race or culture or god or whatever was the one that created these new machines of war.  I haven't looked at catapult research in a while.  I remember there are several other references available that hint that catapults might have existed as far back as 550 BCE, though as I recall there was not enough for any consensus.

            " I am not aware of any source that says Hitler took \"\"sundry remedies\"\" for flatulence brought on by his vegetarianism. This story of Hitler as a vegetarian has the look and feel of an apocryphal folk tale intended to turn Hitler into a spiritual figure, according to Payne's opinion represented in the article, an opinion that the proposers are using to bolster their argument for a move.  You're engaging in the fallacy of rotten apples by claiming Payne is an unreliable source about Hitler's diet simply because he made an error about a separate incident that has nothing to do with his observations about Hitler's diet. We already have other sources indicating Hitler ate sausages, ham, and caviar between 1931-1945. If you wanted to refute Payne, all you would have to do is show that Hitler didn't drink beer or wine, eat sausages or caviar or keep a mistress.  You can't do that, so you are reduced to attacking his credibility on a different subject, which is essentially distracting us from the issue at hand.  Historian Robert N. Proctor supports the notion that Hitler ate meat, so Payne isn't alone in questioning the perception of Hitler's \"\"vegetarianism\"\" over the reality of his fondness for eating meat.  Payne's claim that \"\"Hitler's asceticism played an important part in the image he projected over Germany\"\" is also followed up on by Proctor: \n",
            "\n",
            " ::::::::::Hitler's vegetarianism was remarked on prior even to 1933, however, when the Führer-to-be's personal asceticism was held up as the model Nazi lifestyle. Foreigners eventually took note, recording also some apparent backsliding.  Otto D. Tolischus in 1937 in the New York Times pointed out that the Führer was a vegetarian who \"\"does not drink or smoke\"\" but who also \"\"occassionally relishes a slice of ham\"\" along with delicacies such as caviar and chocolates.  Postwar observers have often—and understandably—used this to question whether Hitler was in fact a vegetarian. \n",

Gestapo chief Rudolf Diels after the war wrote that HItler would sometimes eat Bavarian liver dumplings (Leberknödel), but only when they were prepared by his photographer friend, Heinrich Hoffmann.  The New York Times mentioned ham and caviar, but HItler was also said to have enjoyed squab...Hitler is said to have been unable to tolerate the idea of animals' being killed for human consumption, but at least one author has countered that this was an image deliberately crafted to popularize the German leader as kind and gentle.  Animal-rights historians Arnold Arluke and Boria Sax have noted that both claims may be true. \n",

Even your first sentence has no relevance to anything (\"\"I am not aware of any source that says Hitler took \"\"sundry remedies\"\" for flatulence brought on by his vegetarianism\"\") Yes, he took remedies fotr flatulence. Whether it was specifically brought on by his vegetarianism is  arguable, but wholly irrelevant. Agument by misdirection. Payne is unreliable in this matter beause he is a potboiler biographer, not an expert, but also because this - and other books of his - are known to contain egregious errors. That is one of the ways we determine reliability. Payne is simply talking crap when he says that Hitler's vegetarianism was a fiction invented by Goebbels.

On the other hand, what seems to become a norm is that even five-parts (or more) appears to involve two or more parts of the same tessitura: let's say that four-tessituras writing may have become one of the norms. (Machaut's mass, on reflection, seems to be in four parts but three tessituras.) You are right and the situation is complex: instrumental quartets of the early 16th century (e.g. in Virdung) involved only three tessituras, etc. Let's say that all this deserves comments in the article that we may have in mind (rather than Barber shop quartets singing in unison!). —\n",

BC, when the Aksumite period begins. The date of Aksum's shift to the Zagwe dynasty (which you forgot to include in the medieval list, btw, along with the Solomonic dynasty) isn't known yet, but it may actually be the 12th century, since Anbessa Widim, a king remembered by tradition to have been one of the last late Aksumite kings, is now attested to ca. 1125-1150 (we have a colophon in a Bible written by the Patriarch Abba Mika'el in 1150, which notes that Anbessa Widim was king when he was appointed in 1129), so the 937 date you have is much too precise and probably inaccurate. It's based on the assumption that Gudit's reign was the beginning of the Zagwe dynasty and the end of Aksum, which isn't necessarily the case. Anyway, happy editing. —  | (Yom) |  •  • Ethiopia\"\n",

Most of these \"\"children\"\" are actually between the ages of 14-17 years of aged, based on information obtained from the freedom of information act. Second, Most of these unaccompanied children already have family here in the states. These family members are paying thousands per person to Coyotes, also known as human smugglers. These smugglers are bringing children to the US and telling them to turn themselves in. Also, its not discussed that 80% of those released don't attend court dates, disappearing into US society. There isn't much talk about the conditions of the facilities either. Also, its not discussed that the overwhelming of these people came because of rumors of amnesty; a majority of them believed that they would be able to stay. Because of the prospects of immigration reform, many family members here thought it was perfect timing to get the rest of their family members here, especially the children. Coyotes also lied to them and found a way to exploit the child trafficking law. This is not, as been written in the article, some FOX News conspiracy, which discredits this piece for impartiality. This has been discussed and can be sourced. This article needs a major overhaul. I'm tempting to believe that it may even be biased and one-sided.\"\n",

            " The term 'mugging' gained its current popularity in the United States, with New York infamously described in the 1970s as 'the mugging capital of America'. However, the crime is as old as history and among other things has been known as highway robbery, purse-snatching, or footpadding (which could be surreptitious or violent). In Victorian times the targets were wallets and gold watches, but in the US there was a big increase in reported street robberies and handbag snatches from the 1960s onwards as new consumer items became popular. In England the fashion for mugging either arose or gained popularity through many social factors in the late seventies and eighties, and became a cultural phenomenon among some urban youths. In some cultures, there was perceived to be a growing tendency for young males to steal from other young males. The principal targets became valuable and popular accessories like portable audio devices, cameras, laptop computers, mobile phones, and other items that can be quickly and easily resold. Excitement, status, and gang initiation are undoubtedly important motives too. In larger United States cities and in the United Kingdom, the news media report and cover muggings as a crime trend, and some observers blamed the news media for a moral panic in England from the early 1970s at a time when “newspaper reporting of mugging(s) emerged and became increasingly sensational”Hale, D. (1998). Popular Culture, Crime and Justice. Wadsworth Publishing Company, California. Nonetheless, as recorded crime statistics, insurance claims, and national crime surveys all show, street robberies remained a growing problem until they peaked at about the turn of the millennium. \n",
            "\n",
            " Such robberies can involve the threat and/or use of weapons and/or violence.  Most mugging victims are uninjured or suffer minor injuries.  However, in some cases victims die from heart attack or stroke when they struggle with assailants, through falling from moving buses or under vehicles, being knocked to the ground and hitting their heads on the sidewalk, being stabbed with edged weapons or shot with firearms, or beaten with blunt force. More frequently than death, mugging victims sustain lifetime dermatological scarring, facial, cranial, and maxillofacial trauma as well as orthopedic injuries which affect some level of disability, and impact labor and life activities. \n",

            " * Preoccupation of sidewalk pedestrians by certain activities such as talking on a mobile phone.

The wolf-pack technique serves multiple purposes. At the moment of the incident the presence of multiple assailants first deters a solo victim from physically retaliating. Several wolf-pack muggers dressed substantially similar can confuse a victim from making proper suspect identification at a police lineup if the perpetrators are arrested. Following the incident, several wolf-pack muggers dressed substantially similar can also split up stolen merchandise and travel in different directions following their crimes to avoid police identification and arrest. \n",

As of 2006 and 2007, ski masks and balaclavas are making a comeback as a popular fashion accessory in some circles. \n",

            " * Unaware of this even more precious jewel that lay just out of their reach, Guralnik and Hagen drafted a manuscript, and showed it to Kibble, asking for any additional input. Fate was about to deal them a cruel blow. During 1964 Britain had had a series of postal strikes, which had delayed the mail. Their memory of events, as described in several accounts,[29] is that as they were about to send the final version of their manuscript to PRL, Kibble came in and announced that in the backlog of mail were \"\"three papers, one by Robert Brout and François Englert... and two by Peter Higgs.\"\" All three also seemed to have discovered how a gauge boson could become massive.  \n",

However, the sad fact was that they had been scooped. They added references to those papers into the text but changed nothing, nor did they add anything as a result of what had happened. They sent the manuscript to Physical Review Letters, where it was received on October 12, 1964.... By that oversight, they had implicitly placed themselves as runners-up... \n",

When Higgs’s paper finally appeared in print, on October 19, Brout and Englert were surprised to see that it included a reference to their own: \"\"He couldn’t have seen our paper, so how did he know of it?\"\" Higgs explained: Nambu had been the referee of both papers and \"\"had drawn attention to the work of Brout and Englert. I added a remark about their work.\"\" Their researches were truly independent; in 1964 manuscripts were typed and then submitted by the regular mail. [...] There is no dispute that Brout and Englert were first to complete and first to publish. So why is it that Higgs’s name is associated with the massive boson and not those of Englert or Brout? The answer is that so far everyone has been addressing what happened to Goldstone’s massless boson. However, there remains the issue of Goldstone’s other boson—the massive one. This is what Higgs had uniquely included in his revised paper, the one that appeared in PRL. Two years later, he developed the ideas in a longer paper, setting in motion the events that would make his name. \n",

Now of course it’s important because... its observation would confirm the validity of the theory.\"\" ... Kibble’s perception of the perceived unimportance historically is in accord with the memories of others, which were aired when the six shared the Sakurai Prize in 2010. For Englert and Brout, \"\"This was our first paper in field theory and we were somewhat isolated.

It's taking them a hell of a long time to do it after all, far longer than any of the other decisions that they've taken which involved bad things happening to me and my posts. Far far longer than doing anything about removing the attacks on Cornellier. Put yourself in the position of explaining how my 3 edits meets anything in WP:Disruptive Editting. Or explaining why reporting personal attacks like the ones I did is disruptive in any way shape or form, to the point of requiring immediate and undiscussed blocking. Perhaps have a go at explaining the preventative rationale behind that. Pick out any one of those 3 edits and tell me why a reasonable person would then label me a troll, which as I'm sure you're aware, is a pretty offensive term. As for this idea that there's no rule against calling someone an ignorant idiot or a fucking idiot or saying that you don't know your arse from your elbow, come on. They're some of the most blatant personal attacks as you'll ever see. And there's countless reams of policy that go into great detail about why you really can't accuse others of having called you a liar if they didn't, or of claiming you fabricated stuff when they didn't, or suggest they did something for motives that you don't and then won't substantiate, etc etc etc. I don't have a 'main account' right now, but you've pretty much hit the nail on the head - the tired old 'sock' panacea is what's in play here. Even then, you'll notice the policy it's a little more nuanced than 'if he doesn't look new - block on sight', and believe it or not, there is the basic principle that you not only have to be socking, you have to be doing something bad with it too, before you get blocked. Well, clearly there's been no dialogue here so they have no clue why I am familiar with Wikipedia and have instead gone for option 1. The second inconvenient part of WP:SOCK is pretty much being fudged here with this 'troll' nonsense and the attempted fit-up on the WP:DE charge.

Further, you blindly conflated one journalist's opinion with, as you put it on my talk page, a \"\"summar[y] of reputable published opinion.\"\" As the Wikipedia page on genre says, \"\"in all art forms, genres are vague categories with no fixed boundaries\"\"; as such, any argument about genre must rely on a range of published opinion, not one the words of one (incorrectly sourced) journalist. These are all errors that would be infinitely forgivable if made by ordinary users. That they were made by an admin, someone who assumedly has invested a good deal of time in Wikipedia, speaks poorly for you. \"\n",

I may understand that some of the contributors to this discussion do not know a world of arabic, but that is a shame when discussing the work of someone (antoun saadeh) who wrote mainly in arabic (his complete works is a 17 volume series of around 200 page each, and cover a nearly 30 years of writing) and a party whose intellectuals (at least 4 generations) have a massive production of memoires, and doctrinal discussions (to name a few concerning memoirs Abdallah koberssi, Jebran Jreij,Julia el mir-saadeh, Ibrahim yamout, Mahmoud Nehme... for doctrinal discussions Said Taki el dinne, Wassim zeineddine, Nassif Nassar, Enaam Raed, Aboud Aboud...). I think some due clarifications are to be made: 1- concerning racism and Nazi claims: a) back in 1934, when he was in french mandate jails and when the Reich was at his peak and eugenism was still in vogue in Europe and America, Saadeh wrote one of the most central books in his doctrine \"\"The Rise of Nations\"\", in the second chapter of the book he makes - based on a well referenced scientific anthropological findings and other writings regarding the development of national identity in Europe - a solid case against races' superiority claim (he clearly defines social interaction between different people of different origin and culture as basis to any real development in human history) and underline that linking nationalism to racism (in taking examples not only of Germany but also of France and Europe in early 18th century) is a very reactionary and dangerous position, that should be combatted in the Arab Levant a land of strong diversity. b) On the other hand it is well known - and referenced, even Pipes and Hitchens would agree so - that SSNP followers are form very different religious (of very diverse sects) and ethnic (arabs, but also kurds, armenians, greeks, turks, persians, franks...) origins. And they might be with some communist parties in the region the very few who could proclaim such a diversity, Hardly a case for racism c) concerning the alleged saadeh's anti-arabs positions. It is striking thow some get to such a conclusion, when one of the 4 core objectives of the party clearly stated in its Goal, is the cration of a pan-arab front. saadeh defended what he called \"\"true arabism\"\", in his view a realistic, operative version of arabism capable of mobilizing development and resistance to colonial and then Zionist threts. He attacked conventional arabism (claiming a one Nation from Mauritania to the comores ilands, and mainly based on the sole lingual link, and the arab islamic culture negating all minority cultures). That does not mean that Saadeh's position is an anti-arab cultural position but that of considering the arab golden era of the middle ages as part of a longer history going from antiquity to present days, building a certain \"\"geographic culture\"\" in a certain geographic territory that is in his view the Fertile Crescent. He sees his Greater Syria and his party as one of the forces in the rise of the Arab World. c) most importantly his social nationalism doctrine is contradictory to any racism or even any chauvinism - that he denounces plainly in his writings. His conception of nationalism has at its core two central founding dynamics \"\"social interaction\"\" and \"\"territorial interaction\"\". The \"\"Moutahhad\"\" is his elementary social and territorial unit, it is considered to be the territorial scale in which basic needs (mainly security, food, shelter and community) could be achieved via social interaction. there is different level of Moutahads incorporating linked nets of smaller Moutahds, and responding to different level of human needs ( As a exemple a village or a town quarter is an elementery Moutahad, a territorial region or a metropolis is a different level of Moutahad incorporating a network of villages or of quarters...). The \"\"Watan\"\" or \"\"Patrie\"\" is the Nation level territorial Moutahad. For Saadeh beeing part of a Moutahad is a simple choice to live in it, and committing ones future to its, regardless of racial, cultural or religious origin. Of course left by itself and ruled by reactionary exclusive cultures set on primary social bodies (clans, tribes, large families, religious groups...), such a space holding great potentials for development will turn out to be a battlefield of tribes and flags, and a backyard for colonial exploitation. That's where he think his Nahda, a Cultural and Political Renaissance is needed to bring in a more liberal modernist spirit - in opposition to the racist Toranic movement of Ataturk or the Fascist approach of Mussolini, he thought to do it not by deneing the multicultural status of the Levant and consider rich with heritage, and by proving in his writings, that none of these cultures are fundamentally racis\n",
